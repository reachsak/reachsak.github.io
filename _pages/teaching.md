### Undergraduate Level

**CMG 1000 – Introduction to Construction Management** (Fall 2025)  
This course introduces students to construction management processes and procedures, relationships, practices, terminology, project types, procurement methods, industry standards, contract documents, and career opportunities. Topics include the roles of the owner, architect, engineer, and contractor; project teams and organizations; their responsibilities and interrelationships; types of contracts; different project delivery methods; bidding and award documents and procedures; construction budgets; cost estimating; construction planning and scheduling; cost control; sustainability; technology.

**CMG 2223 Print Reading and Introduction to Building Information Management (BIM)** (Fall 2025)  
This course provides an introduction to reading and interpreting construction drawings and specifications, along with an entry-level exploration of Building Information Modeling (BIM). In the first portion of the course, students will learn how construction plans are organized and drawn, how to read and interpret architectural and engineering drawings, and how to apply this knowledge from conceptual design through final construction documentation. In the second part of the course, students are introduced to the fundamentals of BIM, with a focus on creating and modifying 3D building models using Autodesk Revit.

**BC 4434 Construction Practice I** (Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Fall 2023)  
This course delves into advanced business and management practices as they relate to vertical construction projects. It covers a wide range of topics, including Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), planning and scheduling, cash flow forecasting and analysis, assemblies estimating, as well as estimating general conditions and overhead costs. Additionally, students will explore site logistics planning, construction contracts and insurance, and the review and management of Building Information Models (BIM). The course also introduces the Design-Build project delivery method.  
*Duties*: Conducted lab sessions and graded students’ labs, homework, and exams. Instructed students on key topics such as Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), planning and scheduling, cash flow forecasting and analysis, and assemblies estimating. Supervised and mentored students on these topics, held regular office hours for additional support, and provided personalized guidance to help students understand course material and industry practices.

**BC 4444 Construction Practice II (Capstone Project)** (Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Fall 2023)  
This course explores and applies business and construction management practices related to the development and preparation of a response to an RFP for an actual Design-Build capstone project. Topics are reinforced through working on a real-life Design-Build project. This course is designed to prepare students to understand concepts and principles of the Design-Build contracting method through working on preparing and delivering responses to an RFP for a real-life project.  
*Duties*: Guided students through the development and execution of their capstone projects, providing supervision on the use of design and project management software, including Revit, MS Project, and RSMeans for cost estimation. Assisted students in preparing responses to project RFPs, offering continuous feedback on design quality and project milestones. Graded student submissions and provided detailed feedback.

**BC 4164 Process Planning and Production Design for Construction** (Spring 2024, Fall 2024)  
Course topics include production systems, behavior of construction systems and workers, relationships between subsystems in the construction process, queuing systems, process modeling, and simulation. This course gives students an understanding of the production process from both a theoretical and practical perspective. It also equips them with tools and techniques to design, analyze, and improve construction processes.  
*Duties*: Instructed students on the use of Primavera Cloud for project management, including scheduling, process planning, and production analysis. Provided hands-on guidance in utilizing the software to model and improve construction processes. Graded student assignments and projects, offering detailed feedback to enhance their understanding of production systems and process modeling.

### Graduate Level

**TEC 5143 – Research in Technology** (Fall 2025)  
This course introduces the means and methods of research used to define and investigate problems in technology-related fields. Topics include problem and scope definition, literature review, research methodologies, data collection, and data analysis. Students will learn the processes and tools for conducting both experimental and non-experimental research, with an emphasis on research design, analysis, interpretation, and reporting. The course also guides students in writing of a research proposal.

**BC 5984 Decision-Making and Risk Management** (Spring 2024, Fall 2024)  
This course explores the theories, methodologies, and tools used in decision-making and risk management from a beginner to advanced level. Students will gain insights into the complexities of making decisions in uncertain environments and learn strategies to manage and mitigate risks effectively. This course is designed to prepare students to think critically and become better decision makers. It will also equip them with risk management knowledge to apply in various contexts.  
*Duties*: Supervised students in performing calculations related to planned and expected values for decision-making in project management. Guided them through the application of risk management strategies and techniques. Facilitated hands-on experience with project simulation using the Monte Carlo method to analyze and manage uncertainties in project outcomes.
