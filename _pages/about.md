I am an Assistant Professor of Construction Management at Eastern Illinois University's School of Technology. I received my Ph.D. from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University’s Myers-Lawson School of Construction with a focus on construction management. At Virginia Tech, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Alireza Shojaei and I am also grateful to be advised by Dr. Xinghua Gao, Dr. Abiola Akanmu, and Dr. Philip Agee.

Prior to Virginia Tech, I received a Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering from Zhejiang University with a specialization in Structural Engineering, where I've spent the last two of the program working as an undergraduate research assistant on the application of Deep Learning for structural health monitoring.

My [dissertation](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/items/805c2d21-d304-4753-8989-c4552da61c31)  research explores the application of Generative AI, blockchain and decentralized governance in smart building facilities management. The overall objective of my dissertation is to explore how decentralized decision-making within facilities management operations works in building cyber-physical systems and shape how physical space can be owned and operated in the future with the use of generative artificial intelligence and web3 technology.

Most of my current research work focuses on data analytics, digital innovation, and the application of emerging technologies in the built environment. My primary research interests are Human-AI Interaction, mixed reality technology, Blockchain technology, generative artificial intelligence, such as large language models and Vision language models, Human-Robot Interaction, digital twin and smart cities, smart and autonomous buildings, machine learning, and Internet of Things. Please find the list of my ongoing [Projects](https://reachsak.github.io/files/projectlist.pdf) here.

I have extensive experience in applying machine learning/deep learning techniques as well as both vision
and large language models to construction-related applications, to enhance smart building control and construction
operations, management, and safety. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time playing soccer and jogging.
