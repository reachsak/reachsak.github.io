I am an Assistant Professor of Construction Management at Eastern Illinois University's School of Technology. I received my Ph.D. from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University’s Myers-Lawson School of Construction with a focus on construction management. At Virginia Tech, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Alireza Shojaei and I am also grateful to be advised by Dr. Xinghua Gao, Dr. Abiola Akanmu, and Dr. Philip Agee.

Prior to Virginia Tech, I received a Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering from Zhejiang University with a specialization in Structural Engineering, where I've spent the last two of the program working as an undergraduate research assistant on the application of Deep Learning for structural health monitoring.

My [dissertation](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/items/805c2d21-d304-4753-8989-c4552da61c31)  research explores the application of blockchain and decentralized governance in smart building facilities management. I also work on different research projects including Smart building technologies , as well as the application of Blockchain Technology, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations,  Digital Twin,  Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models (LLM) in the construction industry. My current research focuses on leveraging advanced digital technologies, including generative AI, machine learning, digital twins, blockchain governance, and mixed reality technology to develop intelligent and autonomous systems for smart construction, intelligent buildings, human-building interaction, and smart cities to enhance efficiency, sustainability in urban environment as well as enabling smart and connected solutions across the built environment.

I have extensive experience in applying machine learning/deep learning techniques as well as both vision
and large language models to construction-related applications, to enhance smart building control and construction
operations, management, and safety. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time playing soccer and jogging.
